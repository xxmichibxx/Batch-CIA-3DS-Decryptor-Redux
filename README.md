## Redux features
* Improved error handling. Invalid CIAs, already decrypted and TWL CIAs will be detected.
* Improved script logging. Logging title, title version. Check programlog.txt for more details in the log folder.
* Proper CIA versioning. Decrypted files will use the same version as the source file. No more version 0 for update CIAs.
* Fixed decryption for CIA Demo titles and System titles
* Updated CTRTool to v1.2.0 (x64)
* Updated makerom.exe to v0.18.4 (x64)
* Including seeddb.bin for games using seed crypto introduced in 9.6.0-24

## Original features
* DLC/Patch CIA > Decrypted CIA, able to install in Citra
* 3DS Games > Decrypted and trimmed 3DS, so it is smaller
* CIA Games > Decrypted CCI (NCSD), not CXI (NCCH)
* Auto detect CIA type (DLC/Patch/Game)

## Usage
* Copy CIA or 3DS files into the root directory containing the batch
* Run "Batch CIA 3DS Decryptor Redux.bat"

## Supported operating systems
* Windows XP (x64) or higher
* Windows Server 2003 R2 (x64) or higher

## Notes
* Already decrypted CIA files won't be converted to CCI. This tool is still a decrypter, not a converter.
* TWL files (Nintendo DSi) are not compatible with CTRTool. TWL CIAs do not need to be decrypted.
* Files with an exclamation mark cannot be decrypted. The decryptor will report them as invalid because it is unable to find them.
